## Project Description
This project aims to analyze customer data from a banking institution to predict subscription behavior. The dataset contains various features related to customer demographics, contact information, and past marketing campaigns. By applying machine learning techniques, we can enhance the targeting of marketing efforts, optimizing resource allocation for the bank.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python installed. You can then install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data Processing
The data processing involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset from CSV.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates and handling missing values.
3. **Feature Encoding**: Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using Label Encoding.
4. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets.
5. **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing feature values using StandardScaler.

The code responsible for data processing can be found in `data_processing.ipynb`.

## Model Training
The model is trained using a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. Key steps include:
- Building the model with layers suitable for binary classification.
- Compiling the model with appropriate loss and optimizer settings.
- Training the model with the training dataset while validating with the testing set.

Refer to `model_training.ipynb` for the complete training script.

## Evaluation Results
The model was evaluated using various metrics to determine its performance:

**Accuracy**: 0.8083

**Classification Report**:

## Conclusion
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 81% on the test data, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer subscription behavior. The precision and recall values indicate a balanced performance in identifying both subscribed and non-subscribed customers, highlighting the model's utility for targeted marketing efforts.

## Real World Importance
Understanding customer behavior in banking can significantly enhance marketing strategies. By accurately predicting subscription likelihood, banks can tailor their campaigns to target specific customer segments, reducing costs associated with ineffective marketing and improving overall customer satisfaction. This project has direct applications in customer relationship management and can lead to increased revenue through more successful marketing efforts.

## Future Work
Future enhancements could include:
- Exploring different machine learning algorithms for improved performance.
- Incorporating additional features or external data sources to enrich the dataset.
- Implementing model optimization techniques to fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Creating a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to make predictions.

## Project Overview

A term deposit is a savings product with a fixed interest rate and maturity. This project aims to predict customer subscription to such deposits, helping banks target likely customers more effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kVnOzZ84avAAY1mA2I_Oh6FH3UPEb-_3/view) and consists of customer demographic and engagement data. Key columns include job, education, loan status, contact type, and subscription outcome (`deposit`).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distribution, correlation, and key features.
3. **Model Training**: A deep neural network model built with Keras for binary classification.
4. **Evaluation**: Model performance was assessed using accuracy, classification report, and a confusion matrix.

## Model Architecture

The neural network model has the following architecture:
- **Input Layer**: 16 features (after encoding and scaling)
- **Hidden Layers**: 2 dense layers with 128 and 64 neurons, `relu` activation, and dropout regularization.
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron with `sigmoid` activation for binary classification.

## Results

- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of X% on test data.
- **Confusion Matrix**:
